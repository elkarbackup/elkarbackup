policy_help: |
 <h4>Name</h4>
 This is the identifier for the policy. It will show up in lists and combo boxes. The name must be unique among all policies, the application will complain if you try to use a name which is already in use.
 <h4>Description</h4>
 Free text to describe the policy. Put here whatever you might find useful.
 <h4>Exclude and include</h4>
 The application interprets each line of the exclude field as an exclude pattern and each line of the include field as an include pattern. By using these fields intelligently you can easily pick and choose which files to include in the snapshot and which files to ignore. The two field interact in the following way for each file and directory in the snapshot:
 <ol>
  <li>If the file or directory matches a line in the include field, then the application includes this file. </li>
  <li>If the file or directory matches a line in the exclude field, then the application ignores this file and it will NOT be backup up. </li>
  <li>If the file or directory matches nothing the file is included in the backup.</li>
 </ol>
 As you can see the application backs up all files by default, excluding only those which match an exclude pattern and do NOT match any include pattern.
 Notice that each job has each own include and exclude definitions. The ones defined in the job take precedence over the ones defined in the policy.
 <h4>Sync first</h4>
 When sync_first is enabled, all sync behaviour happens during an additional sync step. Even hourly calls only rotate the directories, without even connecting to the client. This ensures that the snapshots are consistent with the cost of an additional snapshot used only for syncing.
 <h4>Hourly</h4>
 Snapshots made during the day.
 <h4>Daily</h4>
 Snapshots once a every selected day at the given time.
 <h4>Weekly</h4>
 Snapshots once a week.
 <h4>Monthly</h4>
 Snapshots once a month.
 <h4>Monthly</h4>
 Snapshots once a year.
client_help: |
 <h4>Name</h4>
 This is the identifier for the client. It will show up in lists and combo boxes. The name must be unique among all clients, the application will complain if you try to use a name which is already in use.
 <h4>Url</h4>
 This is connection string for the client. The application will use this value together with the job's path as the full url for the job. Typical values for this field are:
 <ul>
   <li>It can be empty. This is useful when the data we want to backup is mapped in the local file system.</li>
   <li><i>user@domain.name</i> will connect via ssh to the <i>domain.name</i> machine using <i>user</i> as user for the connection.</li>
   <li><i>user@domain.name:</i> Notice the colon. Same as above but instead of using ssh connections it will connect to the remote rsync server.</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Quota</h4>
 The amount of disk space in GB this client is allowed to use. -1 means "no limit". When the configured threshold is reached (80% by default) the application broadcasts a warning to the notification recipients specified in each job. The application discards backup jobs with an error if the disk usage is higher than the quota.
 <h4>Disk usage</h4>
 The currently used disk space by this client.
 <h4>Description</h4>
 Free text to describe the client. Put here whatever you might find useful.
 <h4>Is active</h4>
 If this check box is not marked, then no snapshots will be taken.
 <h4>Pre and post scripts</h4>
 Scripts to run before and after any job belonging to this clients. Think of opening VPN connections, setting up shared folders, etc. If multiple pre or post scripts are selected the order of execution is unspecified.
client_job_help: |
 <h4>Jobs</h4>
 You can edit the most important parameters of a job belonging to this client right here. Don't forget to save your changes after doing the modifications.
job_help: |
 <h4>Name</h4>
 This is the identifier for the job. It will show up in lists and combo boxes. The name must be unique among all jobs, the application will complain if you try to use a name which is already in use.
 <h4>Path</h4>
 The path or the name of the rsync resource in the client.
 <h4>Disk usage</h4>
 The currently used disk space by this job.
 <h4>Description</h4>
 Free text to describe the job. Put here whatever you might find useful.
 <h4>Is active</h4>
 If this check box is not marked, then no snapshots will be taken.
 <h4>Owner</h4>
 By default the user who created the job is the owner and the application will notify him of any problems (see send notices to and notify only). Only admin users can change the owner.
 <h4>Send notices to</h4>
 You can ask the application to notify one or several of the following people (by email) of any events. The application decides which events to notify based on the notify only settings. If you choose to notify an arbitrary email you will have to fill in that email address.
 <h4>Notify only</h4>
 In order to keep the message flow to a minimum you can have the application notify you only of events over a given priority threshold.
 <h4>Pre and post scripts</h4>
 Scripts to run before and after any job belonging to this jobs. Think of opening VPN connections, setting up shared folders, etc. If multiple pre or post scripts are selected the order of execution is unspecified.
 <h4>Policy</h4>
 Select the policy for this job. The policy defines when to take snapshots and how many to store, among other things. If you leave this field empty the application will take no snapshot whatsoever for this job.
 <h4>Use local permissions</h4>
 Rsnapshot makes an effort to keep permissions exactly as in the source files. This might cause some problems in Windows, so if you happen to have permission issues with windows jobs try setting this on. It might also make the backup up files unreadable for the web server.
 <h4>Exclude and include</h4>
 The application interprets each line of the exclude field as an exclude pattern and each line of the include field as an include pattern. By using these fields intelligently you can easily pick and choose which files to include in the snapshot and which files to ignore. The two field interact in the following way for each file and directory in the snapshot:
 <ol>
  <li>If the file or directory matches a line in the include field, then the application includes this file. </li>
  <li>If the file or directory matches a line in the exclude field, then the application ignores this file and it will NOT be backup up. </li>
  <li>If the file or directory matches nothing the file is included in the backup.</li>
 </ol>
 As you can see the application backs up all files by default, excluding only those which match an exclude pattern and do NOT match any include pattern.
 If and only if the include field is empty the application uses the include directives defined in the selected policy. The same can be said for the exclude field.
user_help: |
 <h4>Name</h4>
 This is the identifier for the user. It will show up in lists and combo boxes. The name must be unique among all users, the application will complain if you try to use a name which is already in use.
 <h4>Password</h4>
 You can't read the password in this field, you can only use it to change it. If you put anything but the empty string in this field and save the password will be updated.
 <h4>Email</h4>
 The email is very important. All the notifications for the user will be sent to the email specified here.
 <h4>Is active</h4>
 If this check box is not marked the user will not be able to log in.
params_help: |
 <h4>MySQL configuration</h4>
 This parameters configure the connection to the DB. Be careful, if mess up with them the application will stop working.
 <h4>Mailer configuration</h4>
 This parameters configure the how the application sends emails. Be careful, if mess up with them the application will not be able to send notifications. <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/email/email.html">The documentation from the Symfony project</a> might be helpful.
 <h4>Upload dir</h4>
 The application stores all the pre and post scripts in this directory. It has to be writable for the user running the web server.
 <h4>Remove logs older than</h4>
 The application will periodically prune the log registry so that it doesn't get too big. Any record older than the value specified here will be removed.
 <h4>Quota warning level</h4>
 When the disk space used by a client exceeds this percentage with respect to the quota send a warning message.
 <h4>Records per page</h4>
 Number of lines to show in pagination.
 <h4>Url prefix</h4>
 Depending on the Apache configuration the URL generated by the backups jobs that show up in the logs might be wrong. For example, if http://your.host/client/1 is generated where you would expect http://your.host/elkarbackup/client/1 set this parameter to /elkarbackup.
backupscriptconfig_help: |
 <h4>Authorized keys</h4>
 Adding your ssh public key to the applications authorized keys is required to make backups of the repository.
managebackups_help: |
 <h4>Host</h4>
 The host name or IP address of the NFS server. Leave empty for local file systems.
 <p>This application depends on autofs to mount the remote file systems. If autofs is not configured as expected this field will not be editable.</p>
 <h4>Directory</h4>
 The full path in the local file system or the name of the NFS export. In any case it must start with '/'.
script_help: |
 <h4>About the scripts</h4>
 The application invoques the script using the user for backups. The application sets the following enviroment variables before running any of the scripts:
 <ul>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_LEVEL:  possible values are JOB or CLIENT</li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_EVENT:  possible values are PRE or POST</li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_URL:    the value is the full URL of the job or client</li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_ID:     the numeric job id or client id </li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_PATH:   the full path of the snapshot root </li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_STATUS: The output status of rsnapshot for post job scripts, always 0 otherwise</li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_CLIENT_NAME:  client name </li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_JOB_NAME: job name (empty in client) </li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_OWNER_EMAIL: job owner's email address (empty in client) </li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_RECIPIENT_LIST: job recipients email addresses (empty in client) </li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_CLIENT_TOTAL_SIZE: current client disk usage (in KB) </li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_JOB_TOTAL_SIZE: current job disk usage (in KB) </li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_JOB_RUN_SIZE: data size backed up this run (in KB) </li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_CLIENT_STARTTIME: client backup start timestamp (only available in post-client)</li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_CLIENT_ENDTIME: client backup end timestamp (only available in post-client)</li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_JOB_STARTTIME: job backup start timestamp (only available in post-job)</li>
  <li>ELKARBACKUP_JOB_ENDTIME: job backup end timestamp (only available in post-job)</li>
 </ul>
 If any pre client script returns an exit status other than 0 the application aborts the process and prevents jobs of the client from running. On the other hand, the application will trigger a warning alert if the exit status of the pre job script is other than 0 (backup execution will not be aborted).
 <h4>Name</h4>
 This is the identifier for the script. It will show up in lists and combo boxes. The name must be unique among all scripts, the application will complain if you try to use a name which is already in use.
 <h4>Description</h4>
 Free text to describe the script. Put here whatever you might find useful.
 <h4>File</h4>
 Browse and select the script to upload.
 <h4>Runs as before client script</h4>
 Check this field if the script is designed to run when opening the client.
 <h4>Runs as after client script</h4>
 Check this field if the script is designed to run when closing the client.
 <h4>Runs as before job script</h4>
 Check this field if the script is designed to run when opening the job.
 <h4>Runs as after job script</h4>
